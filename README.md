# BMI Calculator
## The first homework of the JavaScript Module

### **_Introduction_**
The first homework of the JavaScript module was to make a BMI calculator. Though that time the task was to make it in the console.

### **_Project itself_** 
I wanted to test my basic-basic knowledge of JavaScript what I gained during the Frontend module. Therefore I decided to make this homework as a page - and not just in the console. 

 ### **_Used Technologies_**
 1. HTML
 2. CSS
 3. JavaScript

**Aim of the Project**
To see how much I forgot or still remember about JavaScript DOM manipulation from the Frontend module. 

**Challenges within the Project**

1. One of the challenge was validate the input-fields (namely if a text comes instead of number)

## **_What have I learned_**
I practiced DOM manipulation.

## Deployed: 2022. May.
